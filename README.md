Honk! Test Net!
=============
Some tools to help test browser-based network-y things in a headless
environmentment. It leverages Philipp von Weitershausen <philipp@weitershausen.de>


XMLHttpRequest
--------------
The underlying mock-thing-out-er-ator is based on Philipp von Weitershausen's
mock\_server.js impl. Seems to work well.

In a mocha or Jasmine environment, including this file will give you a @server
properly set up and torn down around all your tests.

Usage is as so:

    require 'honk-test-net/http_server'

    describe 'Remote Pants Service', ->

      it 'should give me info on pants', (done) ->
        @server.when 'GET', '/pants', (req) ->
          status: 200
          body:   'Pants Found'

        $.get '/',
          success: (resp) ->
            expect(resp.data).to.equal 'Pants Found'
            done()
